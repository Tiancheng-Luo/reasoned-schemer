# reasoned-schemer

An implementation of the examples in "The Reasoned Schemer" to
Clojure's <code>core.logic</code> library, which can be found at
https://github.com/clojure/core.logic. 

Note that even though the examples are implemented as tests, they are
kept in the <code>src</code> directory, not the <code>test</code>
directory.

## Usage

Examples can be found in
<code>src/reasoned-schemer/chapter<em>n</em>.clj</code>, and can be
run either using clojure-test from within emacs or using <code>lein
run</code> from the command line.
